## Prefixes, parameters, and what-not
All of Guardian's universally-accessible commands are listed below; when performed in Discord, all commands
must follow the server's command prefix (i.e. ``~help`` instead of ``help``). The table of commands below, however,
does not prefix any commands as the bot's prefix may vary from server to server. Some of the bot's commands have
parameters that are also required for the command to work. The parameters are surrounded with one of two types of brackets:
* ``<>`` signifies a required parameter.
* ``[]`` signifies an optional parameter.
