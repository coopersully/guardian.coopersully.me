## Commands
All of Guardian's universally-accessible commands are listed below. Some of the bot's commands have parameters that are
also required for the command to work. The parameters are surrounded with one of two types of brackets:
* ``<>`` signifies a required parameter.
* ``[]`` signifies an optional parameter.
