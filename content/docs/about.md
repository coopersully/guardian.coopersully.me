## An Introduction
The starting goal of Guardian was simple: to create a bot that serves as an all-in-one solution.
I, in the beginning, attempted to create a Discord bot that offered a free alternative to the premium bot-army that many production-level servers require to achieve the amount of features they'd like.
Guardian has of-course evolved and changed over time, but it's goal still remains the same. The project is still in it's experimental phase, but the results look promising. :)

## Using Guardian
The bot is currently public and free-to-use, but please remember that it's still in early alpha.
You may experience some downtime (on the bot's end) and Guardian may not always behave exactly the way it should. If that's alright with you and you'd like to partake in the alpha-testing process,
you can [invite Guardian to your own server by clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=885618073904767008&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
