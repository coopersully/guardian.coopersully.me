## An Introduction
The starting goal of Guardian was simple: to create a bot that serves as an all-in-one solution.
I, in the beginning, attempted to create a Discord bot that offered a free alternative to the premium bot-army that many production-level servers require to achieve the amount of features they'd like.
Guardian has of-course evolved and changed over time, but it's goal still remains the same. The project is still in it's experimental phase, but the results look promising. :)
