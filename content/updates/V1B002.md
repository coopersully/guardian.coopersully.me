## v1.2
* Added a support command! Type ``support`` to report an issue, track an issue, or suggest a feature.
* Added mention-support for Guardian; users can mention Guardian in chat and it'll reply with it's best guess of useful info. This is a great way to help out users to which Guardian's commands may not be intuitive.
* Added better error catching for Tracker Network related commands.
