  This page is an update log for Guardian's development. If this log is for a version other than the most recent,
  the information below may not be an accurate depiction of Guardian's active application. In addition to this, if
  you are reading this log within the first few minutes of it's release, the changes below may not yet be fully added
  to Guardian's active application; certain features such as slash commands and event handlers may take up to three (3)
  hours to fully propagate.

## v1.0
Guardian is officially ready for beta testing. Check out all of the commands & more we've got in store for you in the official documentation.
