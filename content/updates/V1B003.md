This page is an update log for Guardian's development. If this log is for a version other than the most recent,
the information below may not be an accurate depiction of Guardian's active application. In addition to this, if
you are reading this log within the first few minutes of it's release, the changes below may not yet be fully added
to Guardian's active application; certain features such as slash commands and event handlers may take up to three (3)
hours to fully propagate.

- Fixed bugs concerning Guardian's chat mentioning feature (see v1.2 update).
- Added a command to list all statistic-trackers for games. Type ``trackers`` to check it out.
- Optimized/minimized code in all Tracker Network related commands.
- Added Fortnite statistic-tracking; try it out by typing ``fortnite`` in chat!
- Fixed bugs concerning VALORANT's statistic-tracking feature.
