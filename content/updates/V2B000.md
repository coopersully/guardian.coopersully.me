This page is an update log for Guardian's development. If this log is for a version other than the most recent,
the information below may not be an accurate depiction of Guardian's active application. In addition to this, if
you are reading this log within the first few minutes of it's release, the changes below may not yet be fully added
to Guardian's active application; certain features such as slash commands and event handlers may take up to three (3)
hours to fully propagate.

## v2.0
- NO MORE CHAT COMMANDS! Guardian now responds only to Slash Commands (Discord's native command feature).
- Changed events to fit new Slash Commands such as logs, tagging the bot in chat, etc.
- Added ``log`` command to add a note to the logs manually.
- Fixed ``help`` menu to better display the biography of the bot.
- Removed the automatic Among Us "sus detector" feature.
- Removed ban and kick commands as slash commands for these actions are already provided by Discord.
- Removed Instagram API commands (temporarily).
- Removed insult command (for professionalism).
- Completely overhauled Tracker Network commands, fixing several exploits and adding better picnic-error support.
