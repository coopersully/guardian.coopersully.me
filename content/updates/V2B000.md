## v2.0
- NO MORE CHAT COMMANDS! Guardian now responds only to Slash Commands (Discord's native command feature).
- Changed events to fit new Slash Commands such as logs, tagging the bot in chat, etc.
- Added ``log`` command to add a note to the logs manually.
- Fixed ``help`` menu to better display the biography of the bot.
- Removed the automatic Among Us "sus detector" feature.
- Removed ban and kick commands as slash commands for these actions are already provided by Discord.
- Removed Instagram API commands (temporarily).
- Removed insult command (for professionalism).
- Completely overhauled Tracker Network commands, fixing several exploits and adding better picnic-error support.
