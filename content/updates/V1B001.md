This page is an update log for Guardian's development. If this log is for a version other than the most recent,
the information below may not be an accurate depiction of Guardian's active application. In addition to this, if
you are reading this log within the first few minutes of it's release, the changes below may not yet be fully added
to Guardian's active application; certain features such as slash commands and event handlers may take up to three (3)
hours to fully propagate.

## v1.1
* Fixed bugs with the ``apex`` command.
* Added "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive" and "Splitgate" statistic-tracking commands; check them out with ``csgo`` and ``splitgate``.
