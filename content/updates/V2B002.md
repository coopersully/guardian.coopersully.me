  This page is an update log for Guardian's development. If this log is for a version other than the most recent,
  the information below may not be an accurate depiction of Guardian's active application. In addition to this, if
  you are reading this log within the first few minutes of it's release, the changes below may not yet be fully added
  to Guardian's active application; certain features such as slash commands and event handlers may take up to three (3)
  hours to fully propagate.

## v2.2
- Guardian's update logs are now available online!
- Fixed bugs concerning Guardian's chat moderation filter.
- Fixed bugs with Guardian's temporary channels.
- Added scam prevention; the bot will now automatically delete messages containing malicious websites (that it knows of) and timeout the offending user for 1 hour. This allows the staff to have time to respond to the situation appropriately.
- Added a dad-joke generating command (202,426 possibilities)! Try it out with ``dadjoke``.
- Added a magic eight-ball command! Try it out with ``eight-ball``
- Added an "Among Us" meme generating command (after a concerning amount of requests); Try it out with ``sus``.
- Added a command to search for images online using the Imgur API! Try it out with ``imgur``.
- Added a lock command for moderators & administrators to stop @everyone from sending messages and/or speaking in a text or voice channel; this command can be accessed by staff members via ``lock``.
- Added an unlock command for moderators & administrators to allow @everyone to send messages and/or speak in a text or voice channel; this command can be accessed by staff members via ``unlock``. Note that this command, no matter what the previous permissions were, will allow all users to speak and text in the channel specified.
