## v2.2
- Fixed bugs concerning Guardian's chat moderation filter.
- Fixed bugs with Guardian's temporary channels.
- Added scam prevention; the bot will now automatically delete messages containing malicious websites (that it knows of) and timeout the offending user for 1 hour. This allows the staff to have time to respond to the situation appropriately.
- Added a dad-joke generating command (202,426 possibilities)! Try it out with ``dadjoke``.
- Added a magic eight-ball command! Try it out with ``eight-ball``
- Added an "Among Us" meme generating command (after a concerning amount of requests); Try it out with ``sus``.
- Added a command to search for images online using the Imgur API! Try it out with ``imgur``.
- Added a lock command for moderators & administrators to stop @everyone from sending messages and/or speaking in a text or voice channel; this command can be accessed by staff members via ``lock``.
- Added an unlock command for moderators & administrators to allow @everyone to send messages and/or speak in a text or voice channel; this command can be accessed by staff members via ``unlock``. Note that this command, no matter what the previous permissions were, will allow all users to speak and text in the channel specified.
