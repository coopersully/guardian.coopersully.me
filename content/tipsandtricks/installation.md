## [Click here to invite Guardian to your server.](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=885618073904767008&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

Once you've clicked the link above, the page you are redirected to should look like the image below.

Choose the server you want to add it (from the "Add to Server:" drop-down menu) to and click ``Continue``. After clicking continue, the page should change to resemble the second image below.
> If the server you are attempting to add Guardian to does not appear on this list, you do not have the permissions required to invite Guardian to that server. You'll need the ``Manage Server`` permission in any server you'd like to add bots to.

Make sure that you keep the ``Administrator`` permission node checked, as this is necessary for Guardian to work properly. Once we're sure of this, click ``Authorize`` to complete the invitation process.
The page should change once more to reveal the success banner pictured below.
