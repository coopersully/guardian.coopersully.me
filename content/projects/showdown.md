### ðŸ“– What is Showdown?
Showdown is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that completely immerses the player in a superpowered, battle-royale gamemode.
This gamemode requires a fresh minecraft world, but creates an extensive story-driven gamemode in which players are pinned against eachother in a super-soldier training simulation nicknamed "Showdown."
There are brand new weapons, tools, abilities, and overhauled game mechanics to suit the player's combat needs.
