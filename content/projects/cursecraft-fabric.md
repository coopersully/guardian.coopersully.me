### üìñ What is Cursecraft Fabric?
Cursecraft is an all-in-one fabric mod for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience;
it implements new items, blocks, dimensions, game mechanics, and more, all tied together with a connected storyline.
Unlike our previous datapacks such as Vanilla Expansion, the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience.
Cursecraft adds brand new questlines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, potions, enchantments, and so much more.


### ‚öñÔ∏è How does it differ from the Cursecraft datapack?
Cursecraft Fabric is a modification made with the [Fabric API for Minecraft](https://fabricmc.net/); this allows the mod to
drastically change the game at a level not possible with datapacks. All datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition are written in
MCFunction only and cannot change the game's actual code.
