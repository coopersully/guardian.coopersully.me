### ðŸ“– What is Cursecraft?
Cursecraft is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience.
This datapack creates a modpack-like experience with minimal installation, a connected storyline, and so much more.
Unlike my previous datapacks, the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience.
Cursecraft adds brand new questlines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, and so much more.
